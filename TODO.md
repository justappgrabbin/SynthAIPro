## Key Technical Decisions

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express 4 + tRPC 11 + Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: MySQL/TiDB
- **Auth**: Manus OAuth
- **LLM**: OpenAI API (via server)
- **Storage**: S3 (AWS/Manus)
- **PWA**: Vite PWA plugin, service worker, manifest.json

### Design System
- **Color Palette**: Elegant, refined, premium look
- **Typography**: Modern, readable fonts
- **Spacing**: Consistent, breathing room
- **Components**: shadcn/ui + custom components
- **Animations**: Subtle, purposeful transitions
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### Database Schema (Planned)
- `users` - Core user data + birth info
- `conversations` - Chat history
- `messages` - Individual messages
- `projects` - User projects/commitments
- `scaffolding_configs` - App scaffolding configs
- `integrations` - Third-party app integrations
- `files` - Uploaded file metadata
- `agents` - Mesh network agents
- `knowledge_base` - AI knowledge base rules
- `rule_updates` - Self-editing suggestions

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access control (admin/user)
- Protected procedures for sensitive operations
- File upload validation and sanitization
- LLM API key stored server-side only
- Secure session management with Manus OAuth
- CORS and CSRF protection

## Notes
- All UI must be polished and elegant
- PWA must be installable on iOS and Android
- AI responses must be personalized based on birth data
- Mesh network must support multi-agent coordination
- Self-editing neural network must be safe and auditable
